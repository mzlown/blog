This is a picture of me on a hike to gram trail I am the one in pink. on gram trail I saw lots of trees, and a poiseness spiders web not the spider the web, but ust be careful of the bike riders, dogs are aloud though so if you are alergic watch out, it is so pretty I loved it i'v gone on the the trail twice it was great both times.Bye,and happy hiking!
