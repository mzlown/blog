This is a picture of me on the hike Purisima Ridge Redwoods Preserve. My friends and I liked it but it was torture for our legs and we all got super tired and a note of advise is don't go if you would'nt like to be really hot and tired. You should also bring water and if you are willing to go on this long hot hike, bring hiking boots.
