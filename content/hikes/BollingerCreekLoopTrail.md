On my hike at Bollinger Creek Loop Trail there was alot of poison oak but I still enjoyed the hike, the hike also had lots of interesting things to look at and take pictures of, but if you ask me its hard to stop taking pictures. There is also realy nice sceneiry and it is realy cool but some parts of the trail are veary narrow. I saw also saw a coyote it was super small but I also saw it from far away so that might be why it seemed so small. I would go on that hike again, have fun and: HAPPY HIKING! 

Snack of the hike: shrimp chips
