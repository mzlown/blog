Hello I'm going to be telling you about my bike ride at Sycamore it is a paved path with lots of bikes and it's dog friendly so you are aloud to bring dogs if you would like to.I had a great time there and I think that it is very safe and child friendly I was able to go back and forth at my own will so I think the hiking area is pretty safe.You can see a lot of trees and the path has mile marks so you can see how far you have gone,but remember you've got to go back also.Bye,and happy hiking!   &#128525
