Hello I'm going to be telling you about my bike ride at Sycamore it is a paved path with lots of bikes and it's dog friendly so you are aloud to bring dogs if you would like to.I had a great time there and I think that it is veary safe and child friendly I was able to go back and forth at my own will so I think the hiking area is pretty safe.You can see alot of trees and the path has mile marks so you can see how far you have gone,but remember you've got to go back also.Bye,and happy hiking!   &#128525
