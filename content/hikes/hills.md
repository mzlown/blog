This is a picture of me on the hike hills.My friends and I liked it but it was torture for our legs and we all got super tired and a note of advise is don't go if you would'nt like to be really hot and tired.You should also bring water and if you are wiling to go on this long,this hot,this long and hot:it's the hike that yes it is meant for:*HUMANS*!Bring hiking boots.
