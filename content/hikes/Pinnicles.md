On my hike to pinnicles I walked all 5 miles It was really hot and I got to walk through caves and they had water in them so I had to hop across rocks to get out I also saw a bat it was so cool.These are some animals that you can see,for our bug lovers and aracnafobia friends taranchilas can be found there in the spring,and year round (occasionally) there are mountian lions and coyotes but thats about it.After hearing that those animals can be found there you might not want to go but read more to know how to be safe even if you're not scared please read this I don't want you to get hurt so if you travel in big groups it will be less likely to see one or come across one,if you go in the winter,summer,or the fall then you will probably will not cross paths with one and mountain lions just be carefull because I don't have time right now to tell you.Bye,and happy hiking! &#128512; 

Snack of the hike: Trader Joes gummy bears - they're the best!
